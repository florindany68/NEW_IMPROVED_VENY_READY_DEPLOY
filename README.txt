# VENY - Virtual Expert for New Investors

VENY (Virtual Expert for New Investors) is a final year BSc Computer Science project developed at the University of Greenwich. 
It aims to simplify the process of portfolio optimisation for beginner investors using Explainable AI (XAI) and modern machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Recommend stock portfolios based on user-selected risk tolerance (Low, Medium, High)
- Forecast future stock returns using time series modeling
- Provide transparent, human-readable explanations of model decisions using XAI
- Deliver all functionality through a beginner-friendly web interface

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Random Forest Classifier** for company risk level classification
- **LSTM Neural Network** for price return prediction
- **SHAP & LIME** for model explanation
- **Natural language explanations** generated via OpenAI GPT
- **Interactive Streamlit UI** for ease of use

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python, Streamlit, scikit-learn, Keras (LSTM), SHAP, LIME, ChatGPT API

## 📄 Report & Research
